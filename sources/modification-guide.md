## Editing guide

_This guide is designed to help you understand how to modify the content of poster from the pedagogical environment on open models._

The `svg` files in the `sources` folder are the resources used to generate poster images, which can be modified to produce new ones.

### Editing content

To edit content, you can use Inkscape, an open-source program downloadable [here](https://inkscape.org/release).

You can then open the content with `File > Open` from the menu bar to modify text and design.

### Generate an image

Use `File > Export PNG image` to create new images.

The menu on the right allows you to choose the element to be generated; we recommend using `Page` as the default setting. You can then choose the image location and press `Export`.
