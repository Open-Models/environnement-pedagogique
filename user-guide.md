# Open Models Pedagogical Environment

## User guide

This pedagogical environment for open models is a set of material and conceptual elements for educational workshops on open software, open education, open science, open hardware...

The purpose of this guide is to explain how to organize and run an activity using these resources.

These workshops are designed to take place in a variety of contexts and formats, it's up to you to adapt what you think makes sense!

The environment is an articulation of several elements to seek to form a coherent set of explanations on open models.

### Zone operation

**[Thank you for having seen a presentation sheet of an open model [here](sources/) for a better understanding]**

Each open model forms a zone, which means you can create several in different spaces. All zones in the environment interact and complement each other.

Each zone has the following components:

* facilitator(s) familiar with the model
* an open model presentation sheet
* other displays and illustrations related to the model
* a more practical activity
* objects in the environment (computers, 3d printers...) related to the model
* ... ðŸ¤·

The idea is to let people move between these zones to explore the different open models.

The role of a facilitator will be to support people in assimilating these concepts, providing help to understand and to answer questions while mobilizing the available content. A zone may have a specific activity (forge demonstration, search engine navigation, etc.) which will be part of the animator's mission.

Each zone has a presentation sheet that briefly explains the open model. These presentation sheets include notions that are not specific to the model, but which help to better understand open models as a whole.

The learning process is complex and gradual, the interest will be to rely on concepts from other areas and build on them: to enable repetition and anchoring, to go deeper, to question the concept(s)...

Other components in the background such as linked posters but also objects in the environment enable open models visualization.

**The assimilation of concepts involves the more theoretical content of displays, human interactions and the visual environment of an area.**

The aim is to enable people to freely explore open models through the available content while allowing them to have support to interact if the need, desire or curiosity arises!

### Zone organization

#### Open Software

This zone deals with the notion of the forge, the idea being to introduce visitors to these collaborative systems, the "developer factories".

A demonstration taking an open source software, ideally meaningful for the public, to go and discover how these environments work. Show that anyone can come and contribute, with bug tracking and pulls/merge requests, as well as explanations/documentation that encourage people to contribute.

The aim is to show how it's possible to work collaboratively with digital technology while linking up with this idea of digital commons.

#### Open Science

This zone deals with the notion of common digital patrimony, the idea being to show all the resources that can be freely accessed with the example here of open access scientific documents.

The open archive network shows the various organization that have their own repositories and are involved in these dynamics. After explaining the system set up by universities (and other scientific bodies), the aim will be to talk about open access search engines (such as [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/)) to show how to explore this network of archives.

The aim is to show that institutions are moving in the direction of open science while at the same time sharing this new form of access to scientific research.
